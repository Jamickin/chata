	<h3>Introduction</h3>
	<div>
		<p>
			My name is <strong>James</strong>. I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> and
			<strong>designer</strong> who enjoys creating things that live on the internet. I began my
			journey through coding around 2021 when a friend introduced me to
			<strong>JavaScript</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. Since then, I've been continuously
			learning. I also started exploring <strong>Linux</strong> and often toggle between it and
			<strong>Windows</strong>, never really settling on one.
		</p>
		<p>
			I don't like to be tied down to one thing; I enjoy exploring and learning new things. I'm a
			<strong>Jack of all trades</strong> and a <strong>Master of None</strong>. Some things I've
			learned include:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I like the fonts <strong>Merriweather</strong> and <strong>Lexend</strong>. I use the latter
				for body text.
			</li>
			<li>
				I enjoy organizing my life in meaningful yet convoluted ways, which is why I have many
				note-taking apps.
			</li>
			<li>I like learning new things that may not have much use in the grand scheme of things.</li>
			<li>I enjoy reading and have many books yet to be read.</li>
			<li>
				I <strong>really</strong> like coding, especially with
