		<p>
			My name is <strong>James</strong>. I'm a <strong>web developer</strong> and
			<strong>designer</strong> who enjoys creating things that live on the internet. I began my
			journey through coding around the year 2021 with a friend introducing me to
			<strong>Javascript</strong> and <strong>HTML</strong>. I've been learning ever since. I then
			started dabbling with <strong>Linux</strong> and toggle beween it and <strong>Windows</strong>
			often never really settling.
			<br />
			I am a person who doesn't necessarily like to be tied down to one thing. I like to explore and
			learn new things. I am a <strong>Jack of all trades</strong> and a
			<strong>Master of None</strong>. Some things that I have learned, however, are:
		</p>
		<ul>
			<li>
				I Like the Font <strong>Merriweather</strong> and
				<strong>Lexend</strong>. I use the latter for the body text.
			</li>
			<li>
				I like organizing my life in a meaningful and convoluted way, which is why I have a lot of
				note-apps.
			</li>
			<li>I like to learn new things that don't have much use in the grand scheme of things.</li>
			<li>I like reading. I have a lot of books that I have yet to read.</li>
			<li>
				I <strong>really</strong> like coding. Especially with
				<a href="https://svelte.dev" class="logo">Svelte</a>.
